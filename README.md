## Dataset Overview

![Dataset Overview](figures/1.png)

Overview of DH-FaceVid-1K Dataset. It consists of 270,043 video clips along with corresponding spoken audio and annotations, featuring more than 20,000 unique identities and over 1,200 hours of facial video footage captured under various environmental conditions and lighting scenarios. Notably, 83% of the dataset represents Asian individuals, addressing the significant shortage of open-source Asian face video datasets.

<!-- Human-centric generative models are becoming increas-
ingly popular, giving rise to various innovative tools and
applications, such as talking face videos conditioned on text
or audio prompts. The core of these capabilities lies in pow-
erful pretrained foundation models, trained on large-scale,
high-quality datasets. However, many advanced methods
rely on in-house data subject to various constraints, and
other current studies fail to generate high-resolution face
videos, which is mainly attributed to the significant lack of
large-scale, high-quality face video datasets. In this pa-
per, we introduce a human face video dataset, DH-FaceVid-
1K. Our collection spans 1200 hours in total, encompass-
ing 270,043 video samples from over 20,000 individuals.
Each sample includes corresponding speech audio, facial
keypoints, and text annotations. Compared to other pub-
licly available datasets, ours distinguishes itself through its
multi-ethnic coverage and high-quality comprehensive in-
dividual attributes. We establish multiple face video gen-
eration models supporting tasks such as text-to-video and
image-to-video generation. In addition, we develop com-
prehensive benchmarks to validate the scaling law when us-
ing different proportions of our dataset. Our primary aim is
to contribute a face video dataset, particularly addressing
the underrepresentation of Asian faces in existing curated
datasets and thereby enriching the global spectrum of face-
centric data and mitigating demographic biases. -->
